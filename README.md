# Walmart
Walmart stores is a chain of department stores in the US. 

The dataset contains weekly sales in US dollars in various stores. Each store has an ID number and a specific store type. The sales are also separated by department ID. Along with weekly sales, there is information about whether it was a holiday week or not, the average temperature during the week in that location, the average fuel price in dollars per liter that week, and the national unemployment rate that week.
